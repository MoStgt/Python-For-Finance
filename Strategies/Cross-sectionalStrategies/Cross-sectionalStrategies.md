An alpha is one type of trading signal. The output is a single alpha vector 
- Alpha Combination, alphas can be combined using simple logic like adding ranks and averaging. Another mehtod is translate alphas into features and use them as inputs to a machine learning classifier to capture the relationships between alphas that incorporates the information of many individual alphas.
