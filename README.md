## Getting data
## Preprocess/clean data
 - Check for missing data
 - Identify outliers
 - Check for normality
 - Check for stationary data (variance, mean, covariance constant over time), One of the assumptions of linear regression is that its input data are homoscedastic
 - Transforming data if not normally distributed (for expample using log function etc.), Box-Cox Transformation
## Test hypothesis, backtesting
- Identify anomalous patterns in historic pricing data, check if anomalies are statistically significant, consistent over time and nonrandom, check if identified pricing behavior can be explained in a reasonable way
- Regression, evaluating model by using R-squared, adjusted R-squared, F-test
